# Measurements: what the model can be trusted with

Every delegated task wisp offers is measured against a small eval set on a real model, and the
result ships with the tool catalogue so a calling harness knows which delegations are reliable before it
spends a call ([ADR 0026](decisions/0026-task-catalogue.md)). A measurement is one eval run on one
Mac on one day; it is evidence, not a certification.

## Where to see them

- `wisp tools --markdown` and the MCP resource `wisp://tools.md`: a `Measured:` line under each
  tool that has one, with the task, `passed/total`, the model, the date, and what a pass was.
- `wisp tools --json` and `wisp://tools`: the same as `measurements` on each tool.
- `wisp://measurements`: every measurement, including tasks that are not one model tool (`triage`,
  the risk classifier, schema-shaped replies).

## What is measured

| Task | Eval | A pass is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `classifier.system-model` | `ClassifierEvalTests`, 47 labelled commands, twelve held out | the command rated at exactly its level; separately, no dangerous command below moderate is a hard requirement |
| `triage` | `TriageEvalTests`, abridged swift build, swift test, cargo test, and pytest output | an expected failure found, by test name or file:line |
| `summarise_diff` | `DiffSummaryEvalTests`, five small diffs | the expected flag (secret, deleted or disabled test) on the expected file, or no flag for an ordinary change, from the rules and the model together; every file must also get a summary line. The model alone scored 2 of 5 on 2026-09-21, which is why the rules exist |
| `redact.thorough` | `RedactionEvalTests`, a ticket, a service log, a meeting note, build output, a stack trace | every expected value (names, an account number, a user id, an address, a private hostname) replaced by the rules and the model together, and every phrase that must survive unchanged; the judge runs under wisp's own system prompt, as callers' passes do |
| `system_info.topic` | `SystemInfoEvalTests`, eight plain questions about the Mac, twice each, with `run_command` also offered | a `system_info` call in the turn naming the expected topic (and port or process); three runs on 2026-09-23 scored 15, 14, and 16 of 16 |
| `edit_file.replace` | `ToolEvalTests`, ten small files | after read_file then edit_file replace by line number, the file is exactly as intended |
| `respond.schema` | `ToolEvalTests`, six code snippets | the schema-shaped reply parses and names the language |

The sets are small on purpose: they prove the pipeline and catch regressions. Widen a set when the
model gets a case wrong in practice, keeping cases that do not resemble the prompt's own examples.

## How to run and record

```
scripts/check eval record
```

runs `ModelEvalTests` on the configured model with `WISP_EVAL_RECORD` pointing at
`harness/Sources/WispCore/Resources/measurements.json`; each test merges its `Measurement` into
that file, replacing the previous one for the same task and model. A plain `scripts/check eval`, which
is what a release runs, asserts the floors and records nothing: the sets are small, a rerun re-rolls
the numbers (on 2026-09-22 two consecutive runs gave 5 and 6 of 6 for the same task), and the file
should change only when someone means it to. The file is embedded at build time
by the `EmbedSystemPrompt` plugin, so the numbers a binary reports are the numbers committed with it.
Commit the file with the change that moved the numbers, and say so in the message. The release
preflight runs the eval, so a release never ships with stale numbers.

The eval asserts only floors (half or three quarters recall, and the classifier's hard requirement);
everything else is reported and recorded. Run `WISP_MODEL_TESTS=1 swift test --filter ToolEvalTests`
in `harness/` for one suite.

## Reading a measurement

```json
{ "task": "triage", "model": "system", "date": "2026-09-20", "passed": 7, "total": 7,
  "notes": "expected failures found across abridged swift build, swift test, cargo test, and pytest output, by test name or file:line" }
```

`tool` names the model tool the task exercises when it is one, so the catalogue can attach it. A task
with no measurement for the configured model has not been measured there; that is not the same as
failing.
